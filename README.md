## About

Javascript30 is a course created by Wes Bos and is a challenge to build 30 vanilla JS projects in 30 days. It was fun and challenging and a great skill refresher for getting back into some hardcore web development when my tired mom brain couldn't think of fun stuff to build and work on ðŸ˜‹

I watched the videos and worked on my own solutions to some of the challenges before seeing Wes' completed version, as well as added some of my own features. They are great project ideas to work on and small enough that I was able to complete the whole challenge in less than 30 days. I highly recommend it for anyone who has a good understanding of vanilla JS and is looking for some projects to practice. Best of all, it's completely free!
