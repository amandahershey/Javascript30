    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    //console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    //console.log(age, age2); // age2 was set when age = 100, therefore remains 100

    // same with strings, and booleans
    let name = 'Amanda';
    let name2 = name;
    //console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'Mandy';
    //console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Amanda', 'Paul', 'June', 'Cora'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    //console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3] = 'Chloe';
    //console.log(players, team);
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice(); // blank slice copies whole array
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = "Chloe";
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    //const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99;
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {
      number: 99,
      age: 12
    });
    console.log(cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const cap3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
