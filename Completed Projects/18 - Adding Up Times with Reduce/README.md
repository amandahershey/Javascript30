# Adding Up Times with Reduce

- HTML
- Javascript

## About
This was an exercise to take all of the `data-time` data and use 

- [Array.prototype.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Map)
- [Array.prototype.reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)

to find the total time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
